# Title: SOLID Principles Lab

## Description:
Follow these steps to complete the SOLID lab:

1. **Fork** the GitHub repository.
2. Create a new branch structure based on **Git Flow**:
   - From `main`, create a `develop` branch.
   - From `develop`, create individual branches for each SOLID principle:
     - `SOLID/SRP`
     - `SOLID/ISP`
     - `SOLID/DIP`
     - `SOLID/OCP`
     - `SOLID/LSP`
3. Modify the classes in each principle's directory, following the SOLID principles as described in the **README** files.
4. Use **Conventional Commits** for each change you make. Example commit message:
   - `feat: refactor class to follow SRP`
5. Once completed, open pull requests for each branch, merging back into `develop`.

Ensure you follow both **Git Flow** and **Conventional Commits** throughout the task.

## Expected Result:
Each principle applied correctly with well-documented commits and proper branch management.
