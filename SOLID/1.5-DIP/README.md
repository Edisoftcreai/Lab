# Scenario:

You are developing a payment processing system where different types of payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal) need to be supported. The system should be designed so that adding new payment methods does not require changes to the core payment processing logic. The goal is to ensure that high-level modules (e.g., PaymentProcessor) depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.
